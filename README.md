# DataCamp-Building_Financial_Reports
Creating a beginner’s guide for financial analysis through DataCamps Projects

### 1. Understanding the Dataset
We are analyzing financial data from two key datasets:

 - Balance Sheet: Details the company’s financial position—what it owns (assets), what it owes (liabilities), and what’s left for shareholders (equity).
 - Income Statement: Summarizes the company’s income (revenue) and expenses over time.

### 2. Objectives
The goal of this analysis is to:

 - Identify which type of company (comp_type) has the lowest profitability ratio.
 - Determine which company type has the highest leverage ratio.
 - Explore the relationship between leverage and profitability in real estate companies.
   
This helps us understand financial trends across industries and make informed decisions about their financial health and risks.
